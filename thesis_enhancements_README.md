# Arc'teryx SICAS Analysis - Thesis Enhancements

This script extends the base SICAS analysis with additional thesis-quality visualizations, in-depth analysis, and research conclusions.

## Overview

The `thesis_enhancements.py` script builds upon the original SICAS analysis to provide:

1. **Enhanced Visualizations** - Advanced visualization types beyond basic bar charts:
   - Pie charts for proportion visualization
   - Radar charts for SICAS model overview
   - Correlation heatmaps for relationship analysis
   - Grouped bar charts for demographic comparisons

2. **Research Conclusions** - Automatically generates research conclusions based on data analysis:
   - Insights for each SICAS component
   - Demographic trends and correlations
   - Strategic recommendations

3. **Thesis-Ready Report** - Produces a comprehensive markdown report suitable for academic theses:
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings
   - Detailed analysis with figure numbering
   - Strategic recommendations
   - Methodological notes

## Usage

1. Make sure you have already run the basic SICAS analysis script:

```bash
python sicas_analysis.py
```

2. Run the thesis enhancements script:

```bash
python thesis_enhancements.py
```

3. The script will generate:
   - Advanced visualizations in the `thesis_plots/` directory
   - A comprehensive thesis report in `thesis_report.md`

## Visualizations

The script generates the following visualization types:

- **Pie Charts**: Distribution of key metrics and demographics
- **Radar Chart**: Overall SICAS model performance visualization
- **Heatmap**: Correlation between different SICAS components
- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Cross-demographic analysis (e.g., gender vs brand awareness)

## Research Conclusions

The script automatically generates research conclusions based on the data analysis, including:

- Insights on brand awareness levels
- Analysis of content attraction effectiveness
- Evaluation of user engagement patterns
- Assessment of purchase conversion rates
- Measurement of overall user satisfaction
- Identification of demographic trends
- Strategic recommendations for improvement

## Requirements

The script uses the same dependencies as the base SICAS analysis, with additional use of advanced matplotlib features. All dependencies are covered in the original `requirements.txt` file.

## Customization

The script is designed to work with the existing SICAS analysis framework. If you need to customize:

- Color schemes can be adjusted by modifying the `ARCTERYX_COLORS` variable
- Plot styles can be customized in the `set_thesis_style()` function
- Conclusions can be refined by editing the `generate_sicas_conclusions()` function

## Note

This enhancement script is designed specifically for graduate thesis-level analysis and reporting. The visualizations and conclusions are automatically generated based on the survey data and are suitable for academic research purposes.
